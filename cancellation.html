                In 1993, the SDI finally came to a close putting an end to more than a decade of controversy and research. Although it might be dead, it's essence lives on in other programs the US has pursued since then.

                <h1>End of the Cold War</h1>
                <p>
                    With the collapse of the Soviet Union, reduction of nuclear arsenals, and also the disfunctionality of the SDI, funding was severely slashed for the SDI program. This combined with the experimental and unproven nature of the program guaranteed the end of the SDI program, and in 1993, the program had come to the end of the line.

                </p>
                <h1>Succession</h1>
                <p>
                    Although the SDI itself has come to an end, other programs have taken it's place, albeit much smaller in scale, focusing more on missiles from North Korea or another rogue state rather than a superpower attack.
                    <br>
                    One of the successors to the SDI is known as the Missile Defense Agency, which could be seen as a rebirth of the SDI, once again focusing on the protection of the US and it's Allies from missiles and ICBMs.<br>

                </p>

                <h1>The Missile defense agency</h1>
                <p>
                    The MDA has many similarities to the goals of the SDI, but the scope of the project has become much less outlandish, using not only satellites, but also ground based interception hardware like the Patriot Missile System, Drones, and similar land launched interception systems/hit to kill weapons.
                    <br>
                    The US has backed out of the ABM treaty, and it has also come to a close, finally allowing the US to pursue missile defense systems without intervention from the Soviet Union.
