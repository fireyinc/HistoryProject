            <h1>Criticism of the SDI</h1>
            
            <p>
                The SDI was seen as an unrealistic program, a Reaganist utopia, and many of Reagan's senators and close advisors criticised it. Senator Ted Kennedy even went on record calling the program as nothing more than<br>
                "misleading Red-scare tactics and reckless Star Wars schemes". <br>This statement is what coined the program's nickname, Star Wars.

                <h1>Internal Criticism</h1>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of criticism from people inside the government for the SDI program. Many viewed it as an unrealistic and utopian, and also questioned it's functionality. 
                    Many of Reagan's own officials also questioned the project. Notably, George Shultz who was Reagan's secretary of state expressed concerns about the "impenetrability" of the shield,
                    saying that the program is impervious to other delivery methods such as heavy and stealth bombers, and cruise missiles. <br><br>
                    
                    Another one of Reagan's advisors, Lawrence Eagleburger, said "The president seems to be proposing an updated version of the Maginot Line*". Many other critics also questioned the feasibility of sinking billions of dollars into a system that might never even work, or into a flawed idea.
                    <br>
                    A study was also conducted to view the feasibility of the program, and it was shown that at the time, much of the tech needed to make SDI a viable reality was still in very early development, and was barely production ready, let alone to meet the immense requirements of the SDI program, which would require the output power of these technologies to be improved 1000fold or even a millionfold.
                
                    <br>
                    Many also believed the funding for SDI was better placed in public works programs such as healthcare and education than a completely experimental and untested set of technologies that was unproven.

                <h1>Political Criticism</h1>
                <p>
                    Many people believed that the SDI would threaten the integrity of existing US-Soviet policies such as the ABM treaty which limited the number of Anti Ballistic Missile systems to some around the capital, and some around a primary ICBM launch site. Many also believed SDI would end the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction, which is the belief that if either side starts a nuclear war, both will be annihilated to the point of no return.
                    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also asked Reagan to drop SDI in favor of other treaties such as the START treaty and the INF treaty, which both aimed to assist in demilitarization of the 2 countries, and the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobriynin went on record saying "You will be opening a new phase in the arms race"<div class=""></div>

                    <br>

                    Many in NATO reacted against the SDI, saying that American nuclear power was the primary deterrent to the Soviets pushing into Europe, and that by employing these technologies, they are also abandoning their European allies, backing out of their commitment to protect Europe, and also setting up a "Fortress America."
                    
                    The SDI was considered by some to be a direct violation of the Anti Ballistic Missile treaty signed with the Soviets a few years prior.
