                Reagan's plans not only included the defense of the US from Nukes, but he also stated that he would share this system with the world. How well he would've kept his promise is unknown however.

                <h1>Soviet Interactions</h1>
                <p>
                    When Reagan announced the SDI program, one of his main tenets in the SDI program was to hopefully rid the world of nuclear threats by sharing the program with the Soviets, and eventually the world. However, the Soviets didn't react as well to the program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Soviets viewed it as a threat to their sovereignty for the US to have a side-effect-less retaliation system, which caused much trouble between reagan and the Soviets. This inturn caused the development of the Soviet Polyus program which was supposed to blast the SDI sats out of space. However, the launch failed spectacularly when it crashed to the ground. (Polyus was also known as Skif)
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    It is believed by some that SDI was the killing blow for the Soviets to admit defeat, although this claim is refuted by some.
